As a graduate student pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering 
at the University at Buffalo, and a former Software Engineer at Colgate Palmolive, 
I bring a balance of academic rigor and industry experience to every project I 
take on. I’m writing to express interest in opportunities at your company where I 
can contribute to impactful, scalable software solutions.

At Colgate Palmolive, I developed distributed backend systems with Django, GCP, 
Kubernetes, and RabbitMQ, delivering robust APIs that handled over a million 
concurrent I/Os. I’ve led testing initiatives across global teams, optimized 
front-end performance using React and modern UI libraries, and contributed to 
open-source tools like Diesel (Rust ORM) to improve performance for thousands of 
users. Whether building in React Native for mobile or Dockerized microservices 
in Go and Python, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments.

Beyond my work experience, I’ve built projects like a Redis-inspired in-memory 
database in Go, and a stock market predictor using LSTM and real-time Twitter 
sentiment analysis. These initiatives reflect my passion for engineering systems 
that are not only functional but also efficient and user-centered.

I’m excited to bring my technical foundation, product mindset, and eagerness to 
grow into a role where I can build high-impact solutions with a team that 
values innovation and ownership.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to contribute to 
your team’s success and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can 
add value.
