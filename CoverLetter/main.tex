I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Summer 2025 Internship opportunity with Teradata’s Core Database team. As a Computer Science student with a strong foundation in database systems, programming, and cloud technologies, I am excited about the prospect of working with Teradata to develop innovative SQL features and contribute to high-performance, scalable database solutions in the cloud.

My coursework in computer programming, data structures, algorithms, and operating systems, combined with hands-on experience in software development, has equipped me with the technical skills required for this internship. I have proficiency in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python, and I am well-versed in using Linux shell scripting and GitHub for version control. Additionally, I have gained practical experience through projects where I built and optimized SQL-driven applications, which has fueled my interest in database technologies and cloud infrastructure.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Open Table Format project and learn from Teradata's talented team. Although I am not yet deeply familiar with Iceberg or Delta Lake, I am keen to expand my knowledge of these Open Table Formats and explore cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, which are areas I am eager to grow in.

Teradata’s commitment to fostering an inclusive, flexible, and people-first work environment aligns with my own values, and I am motivated to contribute to a team where collaboration and innovation are at the forefront. I am confident that my strong problem-solving skills, eagerness to learn, and dedication to quality work will enable me to make a meaningful impact during this internship.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Teradata’s mission and grow as part of your dynamic team.
