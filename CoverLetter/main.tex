I am writing to express my interest in a part-time on-campus employment opportunity. As a graduate student currently enrolled in the Computer Science and Engineering master’s program, I am eager to contribute to the university community while gaining valuable work experience that complements my academic schedule.

I am a responsible and quick-learning individual with prior professional experience in software development, and I bring a strong work ethic, effective communication skills, and a team-oriented attitude. I am comfortable managing tasks independently and am flexible with working hours around my class commitments.

Working on campus would not only allow me to support myself financially but also remain closely involved with the university environment. I believe my background, enthusiasm, and reliability make me a good fit for a wide range of campus roles.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
