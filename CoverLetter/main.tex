I am interested in applying for the South Campus administrative position. With strong organizational skills and experience in customer service, I am confident in my ability to manage reception duties, including answering phones, distributing mail, and data entry. My proficiency with computers and attention to detail will allow me to contribute effectively to the team.

Additionally, I have a valid driverâ€™s license and am a registered UB student, meeting all position requirements. I am eager to bring my skills to this role and support the administrative operations at South Campus.

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to the opportunity to contribute.
