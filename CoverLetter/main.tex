I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer Intern position within 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). With a robust foundation in full-stack development and 
distributed systems, I am eager to contribute to OCI’s mission of delivering state-of-the-art 
elastic cloud services that empower businesses to tackle the world’s most complex challenges.

In my role as a Senior Technology Associate at Colgate-Palmolive, I have gained hands-on 
experience in building scalable APIs, implementing microservices architecture, and optimizing 
systems for high performance using tools like Kubernetes and RabbitMQ. My technical expertise 
spans languages and frameworks such as React, Python, and Node.js, and I have worked 
extensively with cloud platforms to deploy distributed solutions. These experiences 
have not only honed my technical acumen but also reinforced the value of collaboration 
and delivering solutions that scale efficiently.

I am particularly excited about the prospect of joining Oracle's Virtual Networking team. 
My background in networking protocols, databases, and distributed systems directly aligns 
with your focus on building innovative cloud infrastructure solutions. I am confident that 
my ability to design systems that prioritize simplicity, reliability, and performance 
would make me a strong fit for this role.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring excellent communication abilities and a passion 
for continuous learning. Whether it’s debugging complex issues or collaborating with 
cross-functional teams, I thrive in dynamic environments and am committed to delivering 
results that align with organizational goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how 
my skills and experiences align with the needs of the team at Oracle.
